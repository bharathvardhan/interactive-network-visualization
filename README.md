## Project Overview
This project demonstrates an **interactive force-directed network visualization** built using **D3.js v5**.  
The visualization explores similarity relationships between board games using nodes and links in a dynamic graph layout.

## Designed as part of advanced data visualization work, this project highlights skills in:

- Interactive data visualization
- Network graph analytics
- Front-end data storytelling
- Event-driven UI design

## Problem Statement
Understanding relationships between entities is critical for many data-driven systems:

- Recommendation engines
- Social network analysis
- Knowledge graph exploration
- Pattern discovery in relational datasets

This visualization allows users to explore connectivity patterns through interaction.

### Features

## Force-Directed Layout
- Physics-based graph simulation
- Dynamic node positioning
- Collision handling for clarity

## Visual Encoding
- Node size scaled by degree
- Color gradient representing connectivity strength
- Edge styling based on similarity values

## User Interaction
- Drag nodes to reposition network
- Pin nodes by dragging
- Double-click to unpin nodes
- Labels move dynamically with nodes

## Clean DOM Structure
- SVG-based rendering
- Structured layout for maintainability
- Modular HTML, CSS, JS setup
